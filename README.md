# Demential Detection Tool
 Alzheimer's and Frontotemporal Dementia are neurogenerative disorders and are among the most common types of Dementia. Electroencephalography (EEG), which is an non invasive technique to measure the electrical activity in brain using external electrodes, may provide improved diagnosis of the disease. In this project, we evaluate and compare various machine learning models for this classification problem. 
 
 
 ### Dependencies
 You need to have MNE package installed to read and work with EEG data in python.
 

The dataset for the project can be found on https://github.com/OpenNeuroDatasets/ds004504/tree/main and may be downloaded using datalad. If you are new to datalad, like I was, following tutorial may be helpful (https://psychoinformatics-de.github.io/rdm-course/aio/index.html).
